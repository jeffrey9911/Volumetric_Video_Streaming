We present our work on the design and development of an open-source freely available streaming solution for streaming 4D volumetric video assets over a network. The aim of this work is to reduce the reliance on proprietary solutions to enhance interoperability of 4D assets that can be streamed between a server and a client.

## Setting up

### Dependencies

* Windows 11 or MacOS
* Python, FFMPEG, Google Draco, Unity

#### AWS Hosting

* AWS S3 Bucket as structured below:
     ```shell
    +--- SampleVVBucket
    |   |--- sample-vvfolder-2025-01 # folder generated by script, uploaded to bucket
    |   \--- sample-vvfolder-2025-02
    |           (generated files including a manifest, texture video, and a list of compressed models)
    ```
* AWS Cloudfront Distribution
  
  * Cloudfront origin set to VV S3 bucket
  * Bucket policy s3:GetObject set to allow Cloudfront Distribution

### Unity Client

* Run Preprocess.py, located at ```./Preprocess/Preprocess.py```, and follow the instruction

    * Update parameters or the script as needed

* Upload the generated folder to S3 bucket

* Update ```./Client/Unity/sample_config.json```

    * Update ```baseLink``` and ```folderName``` by your own Cloudfront distribution domain name and folder name in the S3 bucket.
    * OR, toggle on ```Override Config Link```, and input your Cloudfront distribution domain name and folder name as shown below
